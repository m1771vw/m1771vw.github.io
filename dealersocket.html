    <h1>Dealersocket</h1>
    <p>I worked at Dealersocket from July 2016 until January 2017. My reason for leaving was getting laid off due to company budget cuts.</p>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>C#, Java, Kafka, ElasticSearch, Docker, Visual Studio, IntelliJ</p>

    <h3>What Did I Do?</h3>
    <p>I was an Associate Software Engineer at Dealersocket. For the first few months I was in training, where I watched Pluralsight videos and learned about refactoring, threading, encapsulation, TFD, and a lot of other concepts that I never got to learn in school. The problem about this was that even though I learned about a lot of concepts, I wasn't able to put them into practical use, and ended up forgetting about most of the concepts I picked up.</p>
    <p>Once I got out of training, I was put onto a new 6-man team. We were part of a "whitespace" initiative where we would research new technologies and see if the company could use it. We researched technologies such as .NET Core, AuroraDB, DynamoDB, Apache Kafka, and many more. We also did a lot of work on creating a Master Data Management (MDM) model. </p>
    <p>One project I was on was a DCP Customer Insert/Update API where another engineer and I needed to add an improved customer matching logic. We wanted to take an EntityID and be able to match it with the appropriate customer so we can update their records whenever they were entered into our software. We also had to design a logic that would reference customer's name, address, email, etc. to try to find the appropriate matches.</p>
    <p>Another project I was on was to research and develop a prototype internal software the company could use to track employees. I designed and fleshed out how the pages would look, and also researched into NoSQL Neo4J.</p>
    <p>The last project I was on was implementing Kafka Stream Processors. I researched Kafka, helped implement stream processors, and designed parsing and trimming JSON payloads to insert into the database.</p>

		<h2> About Me. </h2>

		<p> I'm a 5th year Computer Gaming Science Major at the University of California, Irvine.
			I am 22 years old, and right now I'm living in Irvine, but I used to live at Hacienda Heights.
		</p>
		<h2> An Anecdote </h2>
		<p> Funny story on how I picked my major - I had no idea what I wanted to do when I was coming into college, so my dad asked me, "Why don't you pick Computer Science? You are always on one, you might as well learn more about them." And with that little joke, I decided to pursue a career in Computer Science. 
		</p>
		<h2> My dreams </h2>
		<p>In the future I hope to work for a game company, and leave an impression on the gaming world with one of my works.

		</p>

		<h3> What I like Doing </h3>
		<div class="accordion">
			<div class="accordion-section">
				<a class="accordion-section-title" href="#accordion-3">League of Legends</a>
				<div id="accordion-3" class="accordion-section-content">
					<p> League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA for short) game, where you control a character in a 5v5 Player vs. Player setting. The goal of the game is to destroy the other team's Nexus, but in order to do so, you must go through the opponent's minions, turrets, and players. Even though I've been playing for almost 6 years now, I still find enjoyment playing the game with my friends.</p>

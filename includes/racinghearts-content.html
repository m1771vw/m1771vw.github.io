    <h3>What Was The Game?</h3>
    This game has a "pet heart" that would have a health meter. There are minigames that when you do well in them, your "pet heart" will thrive and become healthy. Do poorly in these mini games and your "pet heart" will get weaker. 
    
    <h3>History Behind The Game</h3>
    The theme behind the game was to make an educational game that will teach players more about taking care of themselves and how to live a healthy livestyle. 

    <h3>Problems, Mistakes, and Lessons</h3>
    A huge issue was the <b>art</b>. We had three artists on the team, but they each had their own different style of art. Even though 2 out of the 3 had similar art styles, the most senior one wanted to have the most control over the assets and it became difficult to have similar looking assets because the most senior artist had the most unique art style. 
    Another issue was our lack of programmers - we only had one programmer who was experienced with using C# and Visual Studio to develop the game, and we only had another junior programmer who struggled to learn the new language. We were barely able to make our normal page, let alone mini games to show how our game would really work.

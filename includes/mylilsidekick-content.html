		<h1>My Lil' Sidekick</h1>

		<p>This was an Android app created for an Autism App Jam. The purpose of this app jam was to raise
		awareness for autism. This app was created on a 5 man team, and was done over 3 weeks.</p>


		<h3>Technology Stack</h3>
		<p>Java, Android Studio</p>

		<h3>What was the app?</h3>

		<p>The purpose of this application was to assist the parents of autistic children. It would have daily activity lives
		such as grocery shopping, going to the airport, or even ordering food. The app would have techniques to help teach their autistic children how to slowly learn how to do these </p>

		<h3>Problems, Mistakes, and Lessons</h3>
 		<p>A challenge we had was that none of us knew how to program in Android Studio. We had experience programming in Java, but learning Android Studio was an issue. In addition, we didn't have a lot of time to meet up to work on this project, so we had to hack it together in the few hours that we had together. Lastly, we weren't able to implement a lot of basic functionality we wanted for the app so we used pictures as placeholders. 
 		<p>Another thing to note, is that this app would only work if the child is not that high on the spectrum and would be more effective for higher functioning children. If they are too non-functioning, they will have a really low chance of even performing the simplest actions.</p>

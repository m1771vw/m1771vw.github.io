		<h1>Website</h1>
		<p>In order to practice my front end development skills, I took a course on User Experience and User Interaction. </p>

		<h3>Technology Stack</h3>
		<p>HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, PHP</p>

		<h3>Iterations</h3>
		<p>I had multiple iterations of my website. I will sometime find time to archive it and make it viewable <a href="old/index.html">here</a>. It's not that great, and I wish I made it better, but that's why I decided to try doing a redesign of it. This is also another iteration of my portfolio that I kind of didn't want to upload because I believe I can do a better job designing the website, but I want to put this out there to show my progress so far. In the future, I will improve on my portfolio to better show my designing skills. </p>

      Hello! My name is William Yang and I am an aspiring Software Engineer and Game Designer!
      I graduted from the University of California, Irvine in 2016 with a Computer Game Science degree.
      Technology has never been so prominent in our lives before -- it is constantly evolving and growing at such
      an exponential rate that we need to be able to keep up with it. I hope to be able to use this technology to
      make our lives simpler and easier.

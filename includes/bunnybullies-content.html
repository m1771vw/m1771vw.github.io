    <h1>Bunny Bullies</h1>
    <p>Bunny Bullies is a multiplayer phone game created for the Computer Game Science Project course at the
      University of California, Irvine. The team consisted of 5 members and was a project done over 20 weeks.</p>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>C#, Unity</p>

    <h3>What Was The Game?</h3>
    <p>The game was a multiplayer Android game on the phone. Each player had a screen full of "trash" and needed to swipe the trash into "portals".
    These "portals" would connect to a certain player, and the special feature of this game is that the trash would go to that player's screen when swiped to.
    There were 3 rounds and each round lasted 30 seconds. At the end of each round, the player would be scored based on how much trash they collected, and
    how many bonus points they collected. </p>

    <h3>History Behind The Game</h3>
    <p>One of our members really wanted to make a game that used all functionalities of the phone: tapping, swiping, gyroscope, microphone, speakers, etc., so we decided to use that idea as the core concept for our game. Another core concept that we wanted to have was to have a multiplayer game that people can locally connect and play with each other on their own phones.</p>

     <h3>Problems, Mistakes, and Lessons</h3>
     <p>We ran into a quite a few problems over the 20 weeks. At first everything went pretty smoothly and everyone was working well together, but the first problem was <b>scheduling</b>. The first few weeks were completely fine before midterms and other projects started, but when other classes started becoming a priority, it became harder to schedule productive meetings because not everyone would be there or not everyone was able to work on it at home as much as they wanted.</p>
     
     <p>Another problem we ran into was the <b>design</b> of our game. We quickly felt our game was just a copy of Fruit Ninja and it wasn't very unique. We decided to scrap the initial design and come up with our current design for the game. This ended up being a good decision because it was still early on in the quarter and our game became more enjoyable after the changes we've made. </p>
     <p>A problem we didn't really realize until later in the quarter was <b>play testing.</b> We didn't really have anyone play test our early iterations of the game until a member brought a build of the game to a wedding and got feedback for it. Without this play test, we wouldn't have known that our game just wasn't <i>fun</i>, nor addicting! No one wanted to play it again, and their opinions were just, "Oh, that's nice," and that really put into perspective that we need to change our game.</p>
     <p><b>Communication</b> wasn't a problem at first, but when everyone got busy and meetings were a bit harder to make, we started doing things on our own.
     One member took it to himself to make changes to the game that he thought would benefit us, or even spend a full week to make enhancements to the game that didn't end up working out. This ended up with frustrations throughout the team and also a waste of time. Another communication issue we had with another member was that he really wanted to implement Google Play achievements into our game. It was a cool idea, but not practical if we didn't have a solid game to put achievements on in the first place!</p>
     <p>Lastly, another problem is meeting deadlines. One of my biggest mistakes was not having a build ready for our last play test. The reason why this happened was because we thought we had enough time to fix a bug, but we ended up not fixing the issue, so we ended up having to do our playtest with a much older build. This led to us not having a lot of feedback from this playtest that we didn't hear previously, and set us further from improving on our game.</p>

    <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
    <p>I don't want to have any future improvements on this game, but I want to try to recreate a similar game to this, where players can connect to each other locally and play from their phones.</p>

     <h3>Extra Notes</h3>
     <p>We had Blizzard mentors who helped us throughout the 20 weeks. They were extremely helpful in giving us advice on designing the game, and scoping our project. It was definitely a great experience and I appreciate everything that they have done for us. It was really beneficial to have an extra pair of experienced designers give us their insight to help us improve on our game.</p>

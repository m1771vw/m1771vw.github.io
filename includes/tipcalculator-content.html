    <h1>Tip Calculator</h1>
    <p>Tip Calculator is an iOS application that I developed because I really wanted something that would calculate tip for me.
 
    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>Swift, iOS</p>

    <h3>What Was The Application?</h3>
    <p>This application is a single view application that takes in one thing: Your Meal Total. From there, it will calculate how much you need to tip and the final amount with tip added for 10%, 15%, and 18% tip.

    <h3>History Behind The Application</h3>
    <p>I'm the one who is usually paying for meals (with friends), and I always have to do tip. I usually pull out the calculator app and have to calculate everything manually, so I thought, "Why isn't there an app for this?" There actually was, but I wanted to make it on my own for good practice, so that's how this Tip Calculator came to be.
     </p>

     <h3>Problems, Mistakes, and Lessons</h3>
     <p> I didn't run into any issues with this version because it's simple and small, but I want to make some improvements. </p>

     <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
     <p>An improvement I want to make on the application is to have multiple percentage choices. </p>

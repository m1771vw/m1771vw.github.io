    <h1>Costa Mesa City Hall</h1>
    <p>In the spring of 2015, I was an IT Intern for the Costa Mesa City Hall. This internship lasted for six months and I left once it ended.</p>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, ElasticSearch</p>

    <h3>What Did I Do There?</h3>
    <p>My task was to create a search engine where they could just search there and it would go through all the other databases.
    For example, if they wanted to search for a certain report, they wouldn't need to search through the police database, the fire department database, so on and so forth.
    This task was mostly done in Java, Spring, and Hibernate. This was my first time working with MVC and with a framework so I was very underprepared going into this internship.
    </p>
    <p>Another task was to manage their Intranet webpages. I had to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to update and automate some pages.</p>

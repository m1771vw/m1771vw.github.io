    <h1>Daybreak</h1>
    <p>Daybreak was a single player platformer Java game created for the University of California, Irvine Video Game Design Club Winter Game Jam of 2012.
    The team consisted of 8 members. This fast paced game won first place in the VGDC Game Jam.</p>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>Java</p>

    <h3>What Was The Game?</h3>
    <p>The player is trapped inside a cemetery and has to break the tombstones to free himself from the level.
    However, the player can only break the tombstones during the day -- once it turned night time, the gravestones are unbreakable
    and ghosts appear from the broken tombstones and try to hunt you down. </p>
   
    <h3>History Behind The Game</h3>
    This game was developed in a game jam for the Video Game Design Club. The theme of the game jam was "change", so our team decided to use the change from day to night for our game and came up with the cemetary setting.

    <h3>Problems, Mistakes, and Lessons</h3>  
    Our team had a lot of beginners so it was a little hard to get started and to have us work on parts of the game. However, this was a great learning experience for all of us and helped us understand how to use inheritence and the importance of object oriented programming.
